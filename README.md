# Legion + LOQ Control

Legion + LOQ Control is a lightweight, open-source alternative to Lenovo Vantage for Legion and LOQ laptops.

Lenovo Vantage is heavy, inconsistent, and often breaks after updates.
This tool focuses on the essentials: power modes, battery limits, and hardware insight — without running background services or collecting telemetry.

**Note:** Not affiliated with Lenovo.

## What it does
